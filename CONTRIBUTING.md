# Contribute

 - Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a
   feature idea or a bug. There is a **contribute!** tag for issues that should be
   ideal for people who are not very familiar with the codebase yet.
 - Fork the repository on Github to start making your changes on a topic branch.
 - Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works as expected.
 - Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published.
   Make sure to add yourself to *CONTRIBUTORS*.

Otherwise, if you simply wants to suggest a feature or report a bug, create an issue :
